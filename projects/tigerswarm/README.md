# TigerSwarm

You need a TigerBeetle instance running locally on port `3000` (or change the `addresses` variable
in `lib/tigerswarm/application.ex` to point to your instance).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
